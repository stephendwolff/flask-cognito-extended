A storage engine to save revoked tokens. In production if
speed is the primary concern, redis is a good bet. If data
persistence is more important for you, postgres is another
great option. In this example, we will be using an in memory
store, just to show you how this might work.
"""

"""
For this example, we are just checking if the tokens jti
(unique identifier) is in the blacklist set. This could
be made more complex, for example storing all tokens
into the blacklist with a revoked status when created,
and returning the revoked status in this call. This
would allow you to have a list of all created tokens,
and to consider tokens that aren't in the blacklist
(aka tokens you didn't create) as revoked. These are
just two options, and this can be tailored to whatever
your application needs.

Calls the LOGOUT endpoint.
According to the documentation, this endpoint signs the user out.
It clears out the existing session and redirects back to the client.
However, this does not expire the access and id tokens.
We will revoke them manually by adding it to blacklist and
removing the access token from cookie.
